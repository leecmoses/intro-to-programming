<h1>Lesson 02</h1>

<h2> 1. Introduction </h2>
    * Web pages are wrriten in HTML, and the links among web pages and other resources are what makes the web 'web-like'<br>

<h2> 2. Practice - Introduction </h2>
    * HTML is the main language that we use to write web pages<br>
    <br>* HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language<br>
    <br>* Hypertext is text that can have references (such as links) to other documents and resources<br>
    <br>* Hypertext is all about references and links<br>
    <br>* A web browser is an application, like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari, that is designed for displaying web pages<br>
    <br>* Web pages are usually stored on servers<br>
    <br>* Usually, to load a web page, your browser sends a request for that page to a server<br>

<h2> 3. Web pages and servers</h2>
    * HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol<br>
    <br>* HTTP is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information systems<br>
    <br>* HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web<br>
    <br>* Hypertext is structured text that uses logical links (hyperlinks) between notes containing text<br>

<h2> 4. Practice - Web pages and servers</h2>
    * The difference between address with http: and https: is whether the browser uses encryption to keep your data private ( the S stands for Secure)<br>
    <br>* Only need to upload it to a web server when you want it to be available on the Web (so that other people can access it from their computers)<br>

<h2> 5. HTML and programming</h2>
    * The Mozilla Developer Network is a major resources for web developers - https://developer.mozilla.org/<br>

<h2> 6. Text editors and files</h2>
    * A story that your wrote in your text editor IS text<br>
    <br>* A piece of recorded music on your phone IS NOT text<br>
    <br>* The HTML for the Udacity home page IS text<br>
    <br>* A photo of a dog doing a sily trick IS NOT text<br>
    <br>* PDF file of a legal contract IS NOT text<br>

<h2> 7. The Job of HTML</h2>
    * Text that the user will actually read in their browser<br>
    <br>* Markup, which tells the browser what that text should look like, or how it's arranged<br>

<h2> 8. Markup</h2>
    * The tag <em>em </em> is used to italicize something<br>

<h2> 9. Practice - Markup</h2>
    * In practice, you'll often see people mix up the terms element and tag, you can tell what they mean by the context<br>
    <br>* Spaces, tabs, and line breaks are called <strong>whitespace</strong><br>

<h2> 10. Breaks and empty elements</h2>
    * The tag <em>br</em> is used to create line breaks<br>
    <br>* the br tag does not have a closing tag and is an example of void or empty elements<br>

<h2> 11. Paragraphs</h2>
    <p>
        * The tag <em>p</em> is used to create paragraphs<br>
        <br> * The p tag is more useful to use for line breaks than the br tag when using CSS
    </p>

<h2> 12. Practice - Midpoint review</h2>
    <p>
        * As a rule, it's good to 'tell the truth' in your HTML code<br>
        <br>* <em>Syntax</em> is the grammar rules of a language<br>
        <br>* <em>Nesting</em> is the idea that some bits of code can go inside other bits of code<br>
        <br>* When programmers say 'computers are stupid,' what they really mean is that computeres take code completely literally; if you make a typo, the computer will not guess at what you really meant.<br>
    </p>

<h2> 13. Lots of elements</h2>
    <p>
        <br>* The <mark>mark </mark> tag highlights the element<br>
        <br>* What does the <sub>sub</sub> tag do?<br>
        <br>* What does the <sup>sup</sup> tag do?<br>
        <br>* The sub and sup tags move the text vertially, as subscript or superscript<br>
        <br>* Originally, HTML started out as a tool for scientific and academic work; and these are really useful for science and math<br>
    </p>

<h2> 14. Nested elements</h2>
    <p>
        <br>* Nested elements should not overlap<br>
    </p>
