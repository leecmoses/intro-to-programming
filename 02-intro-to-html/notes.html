    <h1>Intro to HTML</h1>

    <h2> 1. Introduction </h2>
        * Web pages are wrriten in HTML, and the links among web pages and other resources are what makes the web 'web-like'<br>
    
    <h2> 2. Practice - Introduction </h2>
        * HTML is the main language that we use to write web pages<br>
        <br>* HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language<br>
        <br>* Hypertext is text that can have references (such as links) to other documents and resources<br>
        <br>* Hypertext is all about references and links<br>
        <br>* A web browser is an application, like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari, that is designed for displaying web pages<br>
        <br>* Web pages are usually stored on servers<br>
        <br>* Usually, to load a web page, your browser sends a request for that page to a server<br>
    
    <h2> 3. Web pages and servers</h2>
        * HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol<br>
        <br>* HTTP is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information systems<br>
        <br>* HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web<br>
        <br>* Hypertext is structured text that uses logical links (hyperlinks) between notes containing text<br>
    
    <h2> 4. Practice - Web pages and servers</h2>
        * The difference between address with http: and https: is whether the browser uses encryption to keep your data private ( the S stands for Secure)<br>
        <br>* Only need to upload it to a web server when you want it to be available on the Web (so that other people can access it from their computers)<br>
    
    <h2> 5. HTML and programming</h2>
        * The Mozilla Developer Network is a major resources for web developers - https://developer.mozilla.org/<br>
    
    <h2> 6. Text editors and files</h2>
        * A story that your wrote in your text editor IS text<br>
        <br>* A piece of recorded music on your phone IS NOT text<br>
        <br>* The HTML for the Udacity home page IS text<br>
        <br>* A photo of a dog doing a sily trick IS NOT text<br>
        <br>* PDF file of a legal contract IS NOT text<br>
    
    <h2> 7. The Job of HTML</h2>
        * Text that the user will actually read in their browser<br>
        <br>* Markup, which tells the browser what that text should look like, or how it's arranged<br>
    
    <h2> 8. Markup</h2>
        * The tag <em>em </em> is used to italicize something<br>
    
    <h2> 9. Practice - Markup</h2>
        * In practice, you'll often see people mix up the terms element and tag, you can tell what they mean by the context<br>
        <br>* Spaces, tabs, and line breaks are called <strong>whitespace</strong><br>
    
    <h2> 10. Breaks and empty elements</h2>
        * The tag <em>br</em> is used to create line breaks<br>
        <br>* the br tag does not have a closing tag and is an example of void or empty elements<br>
    
    <h2> 11. Paragraphs</h2>
        <p>
            * The tag <em>p</em> is used to create paragraphs<br>
            <br> * The p tag is more useful to use for line breaks than the br tag when using CSS
        </p>
    
    <h2> 12. Practice - Midpoint review</h2>
        <p>
            * As a rule, it's good to 'tell the truth' in your HTML code<br>
            <br>* <em>Syntax</em> is the grammar rules of a language<br>
            <br>* <em>Nesting</em> is the idea that some bits of code can go inside other bits of code<br>
            <br>* When programmers say 'computers are stupid,' what they really mean is that computeres take code completely literally; if you make a typo, the computer will not guess at what you really meant.<br>
        </p>
    
    <h2> 13. Lots of elements</h2>
        <p>
            * The <mark>mark </mark> tag highlights the element<br>
            <br>* What does the <sub>sub</sub> tag do?<br>
            <br>* What does the <sup>sup</sup> tag do?<br>
            <br>* The sub and sup tags move the text vertially, as subscript or superscript<br>
            <br>* Originally, HTML started out as a tool for scientific and academic work; and these are really useful for science and math<br>
        </p>
    
    <h2> 14. Nested elements</h2>
        <p>
            * Nested elements should not overlap<br>
        </p>
    
    <h2> 15. Elements review 1</h2>
        <p>
            * HTML has several elements for headlines or section headings, starting with h1 for the largest headlines and going down to h6 for the smallest<br>
        </p>
    
    <h2> 16. Practice - Headings</h2>
        <p>
            * h1 is used for main heading on a page, while the rest are used for sub-headings<br>
        </p>
    
    <h2> 17. Practice - Elements review 1</h2>
        <p>
            * Completed exercises<br>
        </p>
    
    <h2> 18. Block and inline</h2>
        <p>
            * br tells to break the line here called an inline element, while p creates a block element<br>
        </p>
    
    <h2> 19. Practice - Block and inline</h2>
        <p>
            * br is an inline element that just creates a line break, it doesn't have a box around it and doesn't create any margin<br>
        </p>
    
    <h2> 20. Practice - The div element</h2>
        <p>
            * Div is short for division, because that's what this element is for - it's used to divide up the page into different sections<br>
            <br>* While a p element is specifically meant to contain text, in contrast, the div element is a generic container for whatever other elements you might want to put inside<br>
        </p>
    
    <h2> 21. Lists and implied close tags</h2>
        <p>
            * The p element is another example of an element for which the closing tag is optional<br>
            <br>* When you leave off an optional closing tag, it is still <em>implied</em> - that is, the browser will figure out where the element should be closed, even though you didn't explicitly tell it<br>
            <br>* The closing tag li element is optional, so you can include them or leave them off and it will work the same either way<br>
        </p>
    
    <h2> 22. Nested lists</h2>
        <p>
            * Completed exercises<br>
        </p>
    
    <h2> 23. Practice - Indentation</h2>
        <p>
            * Indentation is important for readability<br>
        </p>
    
    <h2> 24. Practice - Implied close tags</h2>
        <p>
            * br element is a <strong>void</strong> element - it doesn't have any contents (unlike p, which does have contents!)<br>
        </p>
    
    <h2> 25. Web address</h2>
        <p>
            * URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator<br>
            <br>* Uniform = standardized<br>
            <br>* Resource = a file or other data object<br>
            <br>* Locator = address for finding something<br>
            <br>* http, https, and file are protocols<br>
        </p>
    
    <h2> 26. Links and the &lt;a&gt; tag</h2>
        <p>
            * a tag is an anchor tag<br>
            <br>* The a element is an <strong>inline</strong> element, links normally have the appearance of a specially highlighted piece of text<br>
            <br>* The a element has both an opening and closing tag<br>
        </p>
    
    <h2> 27. Practice - Addresses and links</h2>
        <p>
            * Completed exercises<br>
        </p>
    
    <h2> 28. Adding images</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="https://picsum.photos/g/300/200/" alt="lorem ipsum photo">
            <br>* img tags have two required attributes, src and alt<br>
            <br>* img elementss do not have a closing tag, it is an empty or void element<br>
            <br>* src is the URL of the image file<br>
            <br>* alt is the text description of the image<br>
            <br>* To create an image that is a link, put an img element between the open and close tags of an a element<br>
            
        </p>
    
    <h2> 29. Files and relative URLs</h2>
        <p>
            * In order for a link to refer to a different web site, it has to be an absolute URL, not a relative URL<br>
        </p>
    
    <h2> 30. Practice - Images and relative URLs</h2>
        <p>
            * Attributes always go inside he <em>start</em> tag of an HTML element<br>
            <br>* The <a href="https://picsum.photos/">lorem ipsum</a> for photos <br>
        </p>
    
    <h2> 31. Elements review 2</h2>
        <p>
            * Some of the inline elements require <strong>attributes</strong>, extra information besides the name of the element itself<br>
            <br>* The alt text is used if the image can't be loaded, or if the user can't see images - such as if the user is using a screen reader<br>
        </p>
    
    <h2> 32. Practice - Elements review 2</h2>
