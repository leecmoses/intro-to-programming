            <h3>4. The os module</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>os module</strong> (miscellaneous operating system interfaces) provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality</li>
                <li><strong>os.mkdir</strong> makes a new directory</li>
                <li><strong>os.rename</strong> moves a file from one directory to another</li>
                <li><strong>os.listdir</strong> lists files in a directory</li>

            <h3>6. Relative paths, and the current working directory</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>os.getcwd</strong> returns the path of the current working directory, this is the shell's equivalent of <strong>pwd</strong></li>
                <li><strong>os.chdir</strong> is used to change directories, this is the shell's equivalent of <strong>cd</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>7. os functions and shell commands</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>os.getcwd -> pwd -> what's the current directory?</li>
                <li>os.listdir -> ls -> what files are here?</li>
                <li>os.mkdir -> mkdir -> make a new directory</li>
                <li>os.rename -> mv -> move or rename file or directory</li>
                <li><strong>Portable code</strong> is code that will work correctly on different systems</li>
            </ul>

                <li><strong>Dunders</strong> have two prefix and suffix underscores in the method name, dunder means "double under (underscores)"</li>
                <li>Dunders are commonly used for operator overloading</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

                <li>If you open a file it is important to remember to close the file too</li>
                <li>A file can be closed using either <strong>with</strong> or <strong>close()</strong></li>
                <li>It is <strong>highly</strong> recommended to use the <em>with</em> for opening and closing files</li>

    <div class="section">
        <h2><span>#</span> Web APIs</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>1. Welcome to Web APIs</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>API (Application Programming Interface)</strong> is an interface that has been created to help two different applications interact with one another</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>2. Getting the weather</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Browsers replace the <em>space</em> character with <strong>%20</strong> because spaces in URLs can introduce errors and ambiguity</li>
                <li>Tim Berners-Lee is the investor of the World Wide Web and he laid out the standards for URLs</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>3. The requests module</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Watched video clip and completed exercises</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>4. Making a request</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Import the requests module then <strong>r = requests.get('URL')</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>5. What can go wrong?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Non-deterministic</strong> means something different could happen each time</li>
                <li>Network checklist: wi-fi, internet service, server address, server running, server understands request, and code understands response</li>
                <li><strong>Status code 404</strong> is when the code sent a request to the server, but the server could not find the page</li>
                <li><strong>Status code 200</strong> is when the code sent a request to the server, and the server successfully sent back the requested data</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>6. Try and exceptions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>NameError</strong> and <strong>TypeError</strong> are examples of exceptions, exceptions signals that an error has occurred</li>
                <li>Error is a generic term while an exception is an error that is detected by Python when running the code</li>
                <li>Python dects syntax erros before the code runs, so the try and exception statements will not catch the error</li>
                <li>Python may <strong>raise an exception</strong> while the code is running</li>
                <li>When Python raises an exception, the <strong>default</strong> behavior is for the program to exit (i.e., crash) and display a traceback</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>7. What is JSON?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)</strong> is just a format - it's a way to structure data so that it's easy to make use of data from code written in many different languages (including Python)</li>
                <li>JSON is easy for humans to read and write, and it is easy for machines to parse and generate</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>8. Dictionaries (1/2)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A <strong>dictionary</strong> is similiar to a list but instead of using indices it uses keys to retrieve a value, also it uses curly brackets {}</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>9. Dictionaries (2/2)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A <strong>KeyError</strong> occurs when trying to access a key in a dictionary that doesn't exist</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>KeyErrors can be catched using a try and except statement</li>
                </ul>
                <li>If d is a dictionary, then x in d asks whether x is a key in the dictionary; that is, whether d[x] will be a valid lookup</li>
                <li>Strings are <em>immutable</em> while lists and dictionaries are <em>mutable</em></li>
                <li>The <strong>del statement</strong> deletes an entry from a dictionary</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>10. Looping over lists (review)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Completed exercise</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>11. Looping over dictionaries (1/4)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If simply looping over a dictionary, Python's default behavior is to loop over the <em>keys</em> in that dictionary</li>
                <li>The <em>method call</em> <strong>dictionary.keys()</strong> returns back the dictionary's keys, this is what Python is doing by default if not instructed otherwise</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>12. Looping over dictionaries (2/4)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Just like the <strong>keys</strong> method that returns the dictionary's keys, there's a <strong>values</strong> method that returns the dictionary's values</li>
                <li>Don't have to use names for the variables like <strong>key</strong> and <strong>value</strong>, but it is a good idea, since it makes the code more readable and helps us remember what the variables are being used for</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>13. Looping over dictionaries (3/4)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Use <strong>items()</strong> to loop over full entries of a dictionary</li>
                <li>Using the method call <strong>items</strong> will return each entry as a pair of key and value, separated by a comma</li>
                <li>A <strong>tuple</strong> is a type of data structure similar to like a list, but is <em>immutable</em> and uses <em>parentheses</em> <strong>( )</strong> rather than square brackets <strong>[ ]</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>14. Looping over dictionaries (4/4)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A big part of being an effective programmer is finding needed information for yourself</li>
                <li>A good resource to use is <strong>Stack Overflow</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>15. Nested data structures</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Either an integer or a string may be used as a key, but neither a list nor dictionary may be used as a key in a dictionary</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is related to the fact lists and dictionaries are both <em>mutable</em></li>
                    <li>For example, if you used a list as a dictionary key and then modified the list, it would be unclear whether you wanted the key to be the old value of the list or the new one</li>
                </ul>
                <li>However, lists and dictionaries can be used as values in a dictionary</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>requests.get</strong> method returns a response object, containing a status code and response text</li>
                <li>JSON data structures are similar to Python lists and dictionaries, it can contain strings, numbers, and other lists and dictionaries nested inside them</li>
                <li>If the string in the <strong>requests.get</strong> does not begin with a URL schema such as <strong>http://</strong> or <strong>https://</strong>, the call will raise the <strong>MissingSchema</strong> exception</li>
                <li>Tuples are immutable, so you get an error saying that this type of object <strong>does not support item assignment</strong></li>

                <li>List of <a href="https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis" target="_blank">public APIs</a></li>
                <li>Misc note: <strong>target="_blank"</strong> and <strong>target="blank"</strong> seem to work the same but they do not</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>target="blank"</strong> tries to open an existing frame named 'blank', so you could use any other word instead of blank, for example <strong>target="whatever"</strong></li>
                    <li>Because the frame (window) with name 'blank (whatever)' doesn't exist, it opens a new window and you have the impression that is the same thing with _blank, but _blank is a reserved value for the target attribute</li>

            <h3>1. Welcome to objects and classes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Object-oriented programming (OOP)</strong> is a programming style that is associated with the concepts of Class, Objects and various concepts revolving around these two, like inheritance</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>2. Review objects and data types</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>One way to tell whether something is an object is to ask whether it can be used as the value of a variable</li>
                <li>A string, open file, and even a function are objects; but a while loop is not</li>
                <li>Every objet occupies a space in computer memory; when the object is created, Python makes space for it</li>
                <li>When variables referring to an object go out of scope, Python can reclaim that memory space by deleting unused objects</li>
                <li>Not every object can be modified; strings and integers can not be modified, for instance</li>
                <li>Strings and lists have some method names in common, such as count and find; but the string type and the list type each also have methods the other does not</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>3. Objects belong to classes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>isinstance</strong> function checks if a object belongs to a class</li>
                <li><strong>type</strong> function returns the class the object belongs to</li>
                <li>All booleans are in the <strong>int</strong> and <strong>bool</strong> classes</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>4. Python classes versus CSS classes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Different languages use same words to refer to slightly different concepts</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>5. Defining a new class</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Completed exercises</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>6. Using class-level variables</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Class-level variables</strong> have the same value across all class instances (i.e. <em>static variables</em>)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>7. Using instance-level variables</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Instance-level variables</strong> have different values for each object instance</li>
            </ul>
