        <div>
            <h3>1. What is Version Control</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A component of software configuration management, <strong>version control</strong>, also known as
                    <strong>revision control</strong> or <strong>source control</strong>, is the management of changes
                    to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information</li>
                <li>Three of the most popular version control systems are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Git</li>
                        <li>Subversion</li>
                        <li>Mercurial</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>There are two main types of version control system models:
                    <ul>
                        <li>the <em>centralized model</em> all users connect to a central, master repository</li>
                        <li>the <em>distributed model</em> each user has the entire repository on their computer</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Git</strong> is the version control tool and <strong>GitHub</strong> is the service that
                    hosts Git projects</li>
                <li>Version control systems aim to solve a specific problem that programmers face: "storing and sharing
                    multiple versions of code files"</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>2. Version Control in Daily Use</h3>

        <div>
            <h3>3. Git and Version Control Terminology</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Version Control System / Source Code Manager</strong>: VCS or SCM is a tool that manages
                    different versions of source code</li>
                <li><strong>Commit</strong>: Git thinks of its data like a set of snapshots of a mini filesystem,
                    everytime you commit (save the state of your project in Git), it basically takes a picture of what
                    all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Think of it as a save point in a game - it saves your project's files and any information about
                        them</li>
                    <li>Everything you do in Git is to help you make commits, so a commit is <em>the fundamental unit</em>
                        in Git</li>
                    <li>When a commit is made, only the changes that are in the Staging Index are saved in the
                        repository</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Repository / repo</strong>: a directory which contains your project work, as well as a few
                    files (hidden by default on Mac OS X) which are used to communicate with Git</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Repos can exist either locally on your computer or as a remote copy on another computer</li>
                    <li>A repository is made up of commits</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Working Directory</strong>: is the files that you see in your computer's file system</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>When you open your project files up on a code editor, you're working with files in the working
                        directory</li>
                    <li>This is in contrast to the files that have been saved (in commits) in the repository</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Checkout</strong>: is when content in the repository has been copied to the Working
                    Directory</li>
                <li><strong>SHA</strong>: is basically an ID number for each commit, "SHA" is shorthand for "Secure
                    Hash Algorithm"</li>
                <li><strong>Branch</strong>: is when a new line of development is created that diverges from the main
                    line of development, this alternative line of development can continue without altering the main
                    line</li>
                <li>The key terms can be found <a href="http://video.udacity-data.com.s3.amazonaws.com/topher/2017/March/58d31eb5_ud123-git-keyterms/ud123-git-keyterms.pdf">here</a></li>

        <h2><span>#</span> Create a Git Repo</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>1. Intro</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>git init</strong> is used to create brand new repositories on your computer</li>
                <li><strong>git clone</strong> is used to copy existing repos from somewhere else to your local
                    computer</li>
                <li><strong>git status</strong> is used to check the status of a repo</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>2. Create a Repo From Scratch</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Running the <strong>git init</strong> command sets up all the necessary files and directories that
                    Git will use to keep track of everything, all these files are stored in a directory called <strong>.git</strong>
                    (notice the . at the beginning - that means it'll be a hidden directory on Mac/Linux)</li>
                <li>Brief synopsis on each of the items in the .git directory:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>config file</strong>: where all <em>project specific</em> configuration settings are
                        stored</li>
                    <li><strong>description file</strong>: this file is only used by the GitWeb program, so we can
                        ignore it</li>
                    <li><strong>hooks directory</strong>: this is where we could place client-side or server-side
                        scripts that we can use to hook into Git's different lifecycle events</li>
                    <li><strong>info directory</strong>: contains the global exclues file</li>
                    <li><strong>objects directory</strong>: this directory will store all of the commits we make</li>
                    <li><strong>refs directory</strong>: this directory holds pointers to commits (basically the
                        "branches" and "tags")</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>3. Clone An Existing Repo</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>$ git clone &ltpath-to-repository-to-clone&gt</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>takes the path to an existing repo</li>
                    <li>by default will create a directory with the same name as the repo that's being cloned</li>
                    <li>can be given a second argument that will be used as the name of the directory</li>
                    <li>will create the new repo inside of the current working directory</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>4. Determine A Repo's Status</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>git status</strong> command will display a lot of information depending on the state of
                    your files, the working directory, and the repository</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>5. Outro</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Watched video clip</li>

        <h2><span>#</span> Review a Repo's History</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>1. Intro</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>git log</strong> displays information about the existing commits</li>
                <li><strong>git show</strong> displays information about the given commit</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>2. Displaying A Repository's Commits</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Always</em> run the git status command, especially when returning to a project after a period
                    of time</li>
                <li>to scroll <strong>down</strong>, press</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>j or down arrow key to move down one line at a time</li>
                    <li>d to move by half the page screen</li>
                    <li>f to move by a whole page screen</li>
                </ul>
                <li>to scroll <strong>up</strong>, press</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>k or up arrow key to move up one line at a time</li>
                    <li>u to move by half the page screen</li>
                    <li>b to move by a whole page screen</li>
                </ul>
                <li>press q to <strong>quit</strong> out of the log (returns tot he regular command prompt)</li>
                <li>By <em>default</em>, the git log command displays: the SHA, author, date, and message of every
                    commit in the repository</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>3. Changing How Git Log Displays Information</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>$ git log --oneline</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The --oneline flag shows just the short SHA and the commit message</li>
                    <li>lists one commit per line</li>
                    <li>shows the first 7 characters of the commit's SHA</li>
                    <li>shows the commit's message</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>4. Viewing Modified Files</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>$ git log --stat</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>displays the file(s) that have been modified</li>
                    <li>displays the number of lines that have been added/removed</li>
                    <li>displays a summary line with the total number of modified files and lines that have been
                        added/removed</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>5. Viewing File Changes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>$ git log -p</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The -p flag (which is the same as the --patch flag) is used to alter how git log displays
                        information</li>
                    <li>displays the files that have been modified</li>
                    <li>displays the location of the lines that have been added/removed</li>
                    <li>displays the actual changes that have been made</li>
                </ul>
                <li>both <strong>git log -p --stat</strong> and <strong>git log --stat -p</strong> displays with the
                    stats info above the patch info</li>
                <li>the <strong>-w</strong> flag ignores the whitespace changes in the patch information</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>6. Viewing A Specific Commit</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>By supplying a SHA, the git log -p command will start at that commit</li>
                <li>$ git show</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Displays only the most recent commit</li>
                    <li>Typically, a SHA is provided as a final argument</li>
                    <li>The output of the 'git show' command is exactly the same as the 'git log -p' command</li>
                    <li>By default the 'git show' displays: the commit, author, date, commit message, patch information</li>
                </ul>
                <li>'git show' can be combined with most of the other flags we've looked at:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>'--stat' - to show the how many files were changed and the number of lines that were
                        added/removed</li>
                    <li>'-p' or '--patch' - this the default, but if '--stat' is used, the patch won't display, so pass
                        '-p' to add it again</li>
                    <li>'-w' - to ignore changes to whitespace</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>7. Outro</h3>

            <h3>2. Git Add</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Running <strong>git init</strong> multiple times doesn't cause any problems since it just
                    re-initializes the Git directory</li>
                <li>Use <strong>git rm --cached &ltfile&gt</strong> to unstage</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is not like the shell's <strong>rm</strong>command</li>
                    <li><strong>git rm --cached &ltfile&gt</strong> will not destroy any of your work; it just removes
                        it from the Staging Index</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>$ git add .</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The period refers to the current directory and can be used as a shortcut to refer to all files
                        and directories (including all nested files and directories)</li>
                    <li>Becareful to not accidentally include more files than you meant to</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>$ git add &ltfile1&gt &ltfile2&gt ... &ltfileN&gt</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>takes a space-separated list of file names</li>
                    <li>alternatively, the period can be used in place of a list of files to tell Git to add the
                        current directory (and all nested files)</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>git commit</strong> command takes files from the Staging Index and saves them in the
                    repository</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Use the <strong>-m</strong> flag to pass your message directly on the command line</li>
                </ul>
                <li>The best way to think about what should be in a commit is to think, "What if all changes introduced
                    in this commit were erased?" if a commit were erased, it should only remove one thing</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Commit Messages</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Some important things to think about when crafting a good commit message:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>do keep the message short (less than 60-ish characters</li>

                    <li>do not use the word "and", if you have to use "and", your commit message is probably doing too

                <li>If you need to explain <em>why</em> a commit needs to be made, you can after the first line in the
                    commit message</li>
                <li>After the message, leave a blank line, and then type out the body or explanation including details

            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>.gitignore</strong> file is used to tell Git about the files that Git should not track</li>
                <li>This file should be placed in the same directory that the <strong>.git</strong> directory is in</li>
                <li><em>Globbing</em> lets you use special characters to match patterns/characters, in the .gitignore
                    file, you can use the following:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>blank lines can be used for spacing</li>
                    <li># - marks line as a comment</li>
                    <li>* - matches 0 or more characters</li>
                    <li>? - matches 1 character</li>
                    <li>[abc] - matches a, b, or c</li>
                    <li>** - matches nested directories</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>2. Tagging</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Tags let you point out particular commits to make them stand out from others</li>
                <li><strong>$ git tag -a beta</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Adds a tag to the most recent commit</li>
                    <li>Adds a tag to a specific commit if a SHA is passed</li>
                    <li><em>-a</em> flag is used to create an annotated tag, recommended becausee it includes more
                        information such as: the person who made the tag, the date the tag was made, and a message for
                        the tag</li>
                </ul>
                <li>A Git tag can be deleted with the <strong>-d</strong> flag (for delete!) and the name of the tag,
                    <strong>$ git tag -d v1.0</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>3. Branching</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>$ git branch</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>can be used to list all branch names in the repository, to create new branches, and to delete
                        branches</li>
                </ul>
                <li>To create a branch, all you have to do is use <strong>git branch</strong> and provide it the name
                    of the branch you want to create</li>
                <li>When a commit is made it will be added to the current branch</li>
                <li><strong>$ git checkout &ltbranch&gt</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Running this command will remove all files and directories from the Working Directory that Git
                        is tracking (files that Git tracks are stored in the repo, so nothing is lost)</li>
                    <li>It will go into the repository and pull out all of the files and directories of the commit that
                        the branch points to</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>$ git branch alt-sidebar-loc 42a69f</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>This will create the alt-sidebar-loc branch and have it point to the commit with SHA 42a69f</li>
                </ul>
                <li>After a branch's changes have been merged, you probably won't need the branch anymore, if you want
                    to delete the branch use the <strong>-d</strong> flag</li>
                <li><strong>$ git branch -d sidebar</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The command deletes the provided branch, in this case, the "sidebar" branch</li>
                    <li>You cannot delete a branch that you're currently on</li>
                    <li>Git won't let you delete a branch if it has commits on it that aren't on any other branch
                        (meaning the commits are unique to the branch that's about to be deleted)</li>
                    <li>To force deletion, use a capital <strong>-D</strong> flag</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>$ git checkout -b &ltbranch&gt</strong> can be used to switch to a newly created branch</li>

                <li><strong>$ git log --oneline -- decorate --graph --all</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Running this command will show all branches and commits in the repository</li>
                    <li><strong>--graph</strong> flag adds the bullets and lines to the leftmost part of the output,
                        this shows the actual <em>branching</em> that's happening</li>
                    <li><strong>--all</strong> flag is what displays all of the branches in the repository</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>5. Merging</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Combining branches together is called <strong>merging</strong>, there are two main types of merges
                    in Git, a regular <strong>merge</strong> and a <strong>Fast-forward merge</strong></li>
                <li>Very important to know which branch you're on when you're about to merge branches together,
                    remember that making a merge makes a commit ⚠️</li>
                <li><strong>$ git merge &ltname-of-branch-to-merge-in&gt</strong></li>
                <li>When we merge, we're merging some other branch into the current(checked-out) branch, <em>not
                        merging</em> two branches into a new branch</li>
                <li>A default message is supplied for a <em>merge commit</em></li>
                <li>Whichever branch the special HEAD pointer is pointing at, that's the branch that will have the
                    merge commit</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>6. Merge Conflicts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A <strong>merge conflict</strong> happens when a merge fails</li>
                <li>Git tracks lines in files, a merge conflict will happen when the exact same line(s) are changed in
                    separate branches</li>
                <li>So the same line on two or more different branches have to be edited... and then try to merge them</li>

                <li>The editor has the following merge conflict indicators:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>&lt&lt&lt&lt&lt&lt&lt HEAD</strong> everything below this line (until the next
                            indicator) shows you what's on the current branch</li>
                        <li><strong>||||||| merged common ancestors</strong> everything below this line (until the next
                            indicator) shows you what the original lines were</li>
                        <li><strong>=======</strong> is the end of the original lines, everything that follows (until
                            the next indicator) is what's on the branch that's being merged in</li>
                        <li><strong>>>>>>>> branch-name</strong> is the ending indicator of what's on the branch that's
                            being merged in</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>To resolve a merge conflict, first choose which line(s) to keep and, then, remove all lines with
                    indicators</li>
            </ul>

        <div>
            <h3>4. Resetting Commits</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>At first glance, resetting might seem coincidentally close to reverting, but they are actually
                    quite different</li>
                <li>Reverting creates a new commit that reverts or undos a previous commit</li>
                <li>Resetting, on the other hand, <em>erases</em> commits</li>
                <li>Becareful with Git's resetting capabilities, this is one of the few commands that lets you erase
                    commits from the repository ⚠️</li>
                <li>If a commit is no longer in the repo, then its content is gone</li>
                <li>There are special characters called "Ancestry References" that tell Git about relative references
                    to another commit:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>^</strong> - indicates the parent commit</li>
                    <li><strong>~</strong> - indicates the <em>first</em> parent commit</li>
                </ul>
                <li>The following indicate the parent commit of the current commit</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>HEAD^</li>
                    <li>HEAD~</li>

                </ul>
                <li> The following indicate the grandparent commit of the current commit</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>HEAD^^</li>
                    <li>HEAD~2</li>
                </ul>
                <li>The following indcate the great-grandparent commit of the current commit</li>

                    <li>HEAD~3</li>
                </ul>
                <li>The main difference between the <strong>^</strong> and he <strong>~</strong> is when a commit is
                    created <em>from</em> a <em>merge</em></li>
                <li>A merge commit has two parents, the first parent is the branch you were on when you ran <strong>git
                        merge</strong> while the second parent is the branch that was merged in</li>
                <li>The <strong>^</strong> reference is used to indicate the <em>first</em> parent of the commit while
                    <strong>^2</strong> indicates the <em>second</em> parent</li>
                <li><strong>$ git reset &ltreference-to-commit&gt</strong></li>

                </ul>
                <li>The way that Git determines if it erases, stages previously committed changes, or unstages
                    previously committed changes is by the flag that is used</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>--mixed</strong> moves the content to the Working Directory (--mixed is the default)</li>
                    <li><strong>--soft</strong> moves the content to the Staging Index</li>
                    <li><strong>--hard</strong> moves the content to the trash</li>

            <ul>
                <li>The word "origin" is the defacto name that's used to refer to the main remote repository, it is
                    possible to rename this to something else, but typically it's left as "origin"</li>
                <li><strong>$ git remote -v</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use this command with the <strong>-v</strong> flag if you want to see the full path to the
                        remote repository</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Git is a version control tool</li>
                <li>GitHub is a service to host Git projects</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>$ git push origin master</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The command takes the shortname of the remote repository you want to send commits to and the
                        name of the branch that has the commits you want to send</li>

            <h3>5. Pulling Changes From A Remote</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>$ git pull origin master</strong></li>
                <li>If there are changes in a remote repo that you'd like to include in your local repository, then you
                    wan to <em>pull</em> in those changes</li>
                <li>When <strong>git pull</strong> is run, the following things happen:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>the commit(s) on the remote branch are copied to the local repository</li>
                    <li>the local tracking branch (origin/master) is moved to point to the most recent commit</li>
                    <li>the local tracking branch (origin/master) is merged into the local branch (master)</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Changes can be manually added on GitHub (but this is not recommended, so don't do it)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>6. Pull vs Fetch</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You can think of the <strong>git pull</strong> command as doing two things:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>fetching remote changes (which adds the commits to the local repository and moves the tracking
                        branch to point to them)</li>
                    <li>merging the local branch with the tracking branch</li>
                </ul>
                <li>The <strong>git fetch</strong> command is just the first step, it just retrieves the commits and
                    moves the tracking branch, it does not merge the local branch with the tracking branch</li>
                <li><strong>$ git fetch origin master</strong></li>
                <li>the same information provided to <strong>git pull</strong> is passed to <strong>git fetch</strong>:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>the shortname of the remote repository</li>
                    <li>the branch with commits to retrieve</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Forking is an action that's done on a hosting service, like GitHub</li>
                <li>Forking a repository creates an identical copy of the original repository and moves this copy to
                    your account</li>
                <li>You have total control over this forked repo</li>
                <li>Modifying your forked repository does not alter the original repository in any way</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Before you start doing any work, make sure to look for the project's CONTRIBUTING.md file</li>
                <li>Look at GitHub issues for the project</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>look at the existing issues to see if one is similar to the change you want to contribute</li>
                    <li>if necessary create a new issue</li>
                    <li>communicate the changes you'd like to make to the project maintainer in the issue</li>
                </ul>
                <li>When you start developing, commit all of your work on a topic branch:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>do no work on the master branch</li>
                    <li>make sure to give the topic branch clear, descriptive name</li>
                </ul>
                <li>As a general best practices include:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Write descriptive commit messages</li>
                    <li>Create small, focused commits</li>
                    <li>Update the README</li>

            <ul>
                <li>A <strong>pull request</strong> is a <em>request</em> for the source repository to pull in your
                    commits and merge them with their project</li>
                <li>To create a pull request, a couple of things need to happen:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>you must <em>fork</em> the source repository</li>
                    <li>clone your fork down to your machine</li>
                    <li>make some commits (ideally on a topic branch!)</li>
                    <li>push the commits back to <em>your fork</em></li>
                    <li>create a new pull request and choose the branch that has your new commits</li>

        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>3. Stay in sync with source project</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The word <strong>upstream</strong> is typically used to refer to the source repository</li>
                <li>When working with a project that you've forked, the original project's maintainer may continue
                    adding changes to their project, you will want to keep your fork of their project in sync with
                    theirs so that you can include any changes they make</li>
                <li>To get commits from a source repository into your forked repository on GitHub you need to:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>get the cloneable URL of the source repository</li>
                    <li>create a new remote with the <strong>git remote add</strong> command</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>use the shortname <strong>upstream</strong> to point to the source repository</li>

                    <li>merge the upstream's branch into a local branch</li>
                    <li>push the newly updated local branch to your origin repo</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Working on an active pull request is mostly about communication</li>
                <li>If the project's maintainer is requesting changes to the pull request, then:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>make any necessary commits on the same branch in your local repository that your pull request
                        is based on</li>
                    <li>push the branch to <em>your</em> fork of the source repository</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>5. Squash Commits</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>git rebase</strong> command is used to squash commits together</li>
                <li><strong>git rebase -i HEAD~3</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <strong>-i</strong> flag stands for "interactive", you can perform a rebase in a
                        non-interactive mode, however, it is recommended to do interactive rebasing while learning to
                        rebase</li>
