    <h1>Intro to Python Part 1</h1>

    <div>
        <h2> 1. Welcome!</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Python is known for being easy to learn and being practical</li>
                <li>Coding is mostly about learning a way of thinking about patterns, repetition, processes, and information</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2> 2. Starting out</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>A <strong>program</strong> is a set of instructions for a computer, a program is made up of lines of code with each line telling the computer a particular detail of those instructions</li>
                <li>The idea of "turtle graphics" was invented in the 1960s by computing educator Seymour Papert</li>
                <li>Originally, the turtle was an actual physical robot, with a domed enclosure like a turtle's shell and it held a pen and could draw on a large sheet of paper</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2> 3. Drawing with turtles</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Completed exercises</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2> 4. Variables</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Variable</strong> is a connection between a name in the code and some data in the computer's memory</li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2> 5. Practice - Variables and more</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Completed exercises</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2> 6. Changing colors</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Being able to say what a program does in detail is pretty important skill for a programmer</li>
                <li>However, it is equally important to be able to summarize what it does</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2> 7. Changing shapes</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>An <strong>integer</strong> is a whole number with no fraction or decimal part, it can be positive, zero, or negative</li>
                <li>Completed exercises</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2> 8. Finding errors</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>The purpose of an error message is to tell you what might be wrong, and to point to the part of your code (usually, the line number) where the problem was detected</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2> 9. Modules and methods</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Python is a <strong>case-sensitive</strong> programming language</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
