    <h1>Intro to Python Part 1</h1>

    <h1>Turtles and Code</h1>
    <div>
        <h2> 1. Welcome!</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Python is known for being easy to learn and being practical</li>
                <li>Coding is mostly about learning a way of thinking about patterns, repetition, processes, and information</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2> 2. Starting out</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>A <strong>program</strong> is a set of instructions for a computer, a program is made up of lines of code with each line telling the computer a particular detail of those instructions</li>
                <li>The idea of "turtle graphics" was invented in the 1960s by computing educator Seymour Papert</li>
                <li>Originally, the turtle was an actual physical robot, with a domed enclosure like a turtle's shell and it held a pen and could draw on a large sheet of paper</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2> 3. Drawing with turtles</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Completed exercises</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2> 4. Variables</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Variable</strong> is a connection between a name in the code and some data in the computer's memory</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2> 5. Practice - Variables and more</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Completed exercises</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2> 6. Changing colors</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Being able to say what a program does in detail is pretty important skill for a programmer</li>
                <li>However, it is equally important to be able to summarize what it does</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2> 7. Changing shapes</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>An <strong>integer</strong> is a whole number with no fraction or decimal part, it can be positive, zero, or negative</li>
                <li>Completed exercises</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2> 8. Finding errors</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>The purpose of an error message is to tell you what might be wrong, and to point to the part of your code (usually, the line number) where the problem was detected</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2> 9. Modules and methods</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Python is a <strong>case-sensitive</strong> programming language</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2> 10. Practice - Draw a square</h2>

                <li>Completed exercises</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2> 11. Comments</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Comments are just for human readers, it doesn't affect how the code runs</li>
                <li>In Python, a comment line begins with #</li>
                <li>It's probably surprising that a speed of 0 means that no animation takes place to show the turtle moving - instead, the turtle jumps instantly from one spot to the next</li>
                <li>command + forward slash is the shortcut for comments on the mac</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

            <ul>
                <li>An important concept to understand is that the assignment happens in the first line of the for loop - but <i>after</i> that first line, we can assign a different value to the variable if we want</li>

    <div>
        <h2> 27. Thinking about errors</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>There are three major kinds of errors that come up in programming: <strong>syntax errors, usage errors, and logic errors</strong></li>
                <li>Syntax errors are like spelling erros</li>
                <li>When you're learning a new language, you'll probably make a lot of them, but once you're used to the language, you'll make very few</li>
                <li>Usage errors are when you ask the computer to do something that doesn't make sense</li>
                <li>Errors like usage errors are similar to saying something absurd, or giving a nonsense answer to a question</li>
                <li>Python's NameError, Type Error and ZeroDivisionError messages usually mean an error of this sort</li>
                <li>Logic errors is when the program runs fine, but it doesn't do what you wanted it to do, because something you wrote isn't what you meant</li>
                <li>Indentation can be tricky, if you find that some lines of code are running more times (or fewer) than you expect, take a careful look at how your loops are indented</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    </div>

    <div>
        <h2> 29. Review</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>A NameError is when the code tried to use a variable before defining it</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
